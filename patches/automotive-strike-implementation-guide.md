Replace the automotive object (first item in the industries array) with the new Strike strategy content. The key changes include:

- **Hero Section**: 
  - Title: "Drive More Sales. Streamline Your Service Bay."
  - More direct, benefit-focused subtitle

  - Each with 3 specific pain points

  - Title: 'Introducing the "Automotive Operations Engine" Bundle'
  - Includes subtitle explaining the bundle
  - Four capabilities: Lead Generation, Appointment Setting, Customer Support, SEO & Reputation
  - Each with 4 bullet points explaining how it works

- **Agents Section**: 
  - Title: "Your Agent's Capabilities, Explained"
  - Updated links to /solutions/novasuite/* pages
  - More specific descriptions

- **Results Section**: 
  - Title: "Ready to Drive Your Business Forward?"
  - Mix of metric-based and benefit-based results
  - 6 key results including 24/7 lead response, 80% appointment automation, 4.5+ review rating

- **CTA Section**: 
  - Simplified to "Ready to Drive Your Business Forward?" with "Book a Consultation"

### 2. Dark/Light Mode Optimization

The industry-sections.tsx component already includes proper dark mode support with:
- `dark:` prefixed classes for all colors
- Proper contrast ratios
- Gradient adjustments for dark backgrounds

### 3. Mobile Optimization Recommendations

For better mobile experience:

1. **Grid Layouts**: 
   - Use `grid-cols-1` on mobile, expanding to multiple columns on larger screens
   - Example: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4`

2. **Text Sizes**: 
   - Hero: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl`
   - Sections: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl`
   - Body: `text-sm sm:text-base`

3. **Spacing**: 
   - Padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
   - Gaps: `gap-4 sm:gap-6 lg:gap-8`

4. **Interactive Elements**: 
   - Ensure minimum 44px touch targets
   - Full-width buttons on mobile: `w-full sm:w-auto`

5. **Performance**: 
   - Consider reducing animation complexity on mobile
   - Simplify 3D effects for mobile devices

## Implementation Steps

1. **Backup current automotive data** in industry-data.tsx
2. **Replace the automotive object** with the new Strike strategy content
3. **Test on multiple devices** for responsive behavior
4. **Verify dark/light mode** transitions work smoothly
5. **Check all links** point to correct NovaSuite pages
6. **Test mobile interactions** especially hover states and animations

## Files Affected

- `/lib/industry-data.tsx` - Main data file to update
- `/app/industries/[slug]/page.tsx` - Already set up to use the data
- `/components/industry/industry-sections.tsx` - Already optimized for dark/light mode

## Additional Notes

- The Phone icon import needs to be added to the imports in industry-data.tsx
- All agent links now point to /solutions/novasuite/* instead of /solutions/*-agent
- The CTA is simplified to just "Book a Consultation" without additional text
- Results section mixes hard metrics with benefit statements for better impact

## Strike Strategy Alignment

The updated content follows the Strike strategy by:
- Leading with specific pain points that resonate with automotive businesses
- Presenting the solution as a comprehensive "bundle" 
- Explaining capabilities in terms of how they work, not just what they do
- Focusing on tangible business outcomes
- Using direct, action-oriented language throughout
