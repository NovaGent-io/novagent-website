# Modular Framework Section - Simplified Implementation

## Overview
This section focuses on two key components that explain NovaGent's Modular Intelligence Framework:

## Active Components

### 1. **Hero Introduction** (`hero-introduction.tsx`)
- "Beyond the Monolithic Tool" messaging
- Introduces the modular intelligence framework concept
- Explains the paradigm shift from rigid to adaptable software
- Clean, centered design with purple gradient accent

### 2. **Core Architecture** (`core-architecture.tsx`)
- "The Architecture Advantage" visualization
- Shows the AI Core Engine at the center
- Displays 5 surrounding architecture layers:
  - Intelligent Core
  - Orchestration Layer
  - Dynamic Capabilities
  - Contextual Memory
  - Security Framework
- Includes 3 key benefits at bottom:
  - Instant Adaptation
  - Intelligent Integration
  - Secure by Design

### 3. **CTA Banner** (`cta-banner.tsx`)
- Call-to-action to explore Agent Skills
- Links to demo scheduling

## Removed Components
The following components were removed to streamline the section:
- Dynamic Capabilities (skill selection interface)
- Workflow Orchestration 
- Continuous Enhancement
- Comparison Table (Paradigm Shift)
- Evolution Timeline (Growth Journey)

## Result
The section now provides a focused, clear explanation of:
1. What the modular framework is (Hero)
2. How it works technically (Architecture)
3. Where to take action (CTA)

This simplified approach matches the screenshots provided and maintains the core message while reducing complexity.
